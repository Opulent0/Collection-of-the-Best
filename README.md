# Collection-of-the-Best
A collection of the best FaOS (Free and Open Source) tools and software there are, and what each is used for and why (both why they are great and why they are used)

This collection will include links to each of them to check out, however I will ***NOT*** be providing any links to the downloads as I fear credibility can change over night. However, I WILL provide links to the official page for each of them and allow you to handle downloading them yourself. 

> [!warning] IMPORTANT
> This is not a concrete list is NOT objective in any way, shape or form. This is purely my taste and a collection of the things I like and use so please keep that in mind. I understand that some tools are regarded as "the best" at what they do, but everything on this list is a tool in my IT/CyberSec toolbox and has a purpose and a place where it shines.
